# Character generation based on user input analysis
During these weeks our team explored the ways and strategies to implement text-to-audio and text-to-image models. We track all the progress in folder "Intermediate_solutions", while the final best-performing models will be stored in "Final_solutions" by the end of the project.

Text-to-audio. \
Abc folder. Model uses abc notation to generate sequences. Shows more meaningful music files for now, so we plan to proceed with fine-tuning it and turning from semi-random assignment to strict difference between mood labels. \
Rnn folder. Contains implementation of rnn and lstm model. After rounds of tuning and ideas we couldnt manage to generate sequences with good sounds, even though some notes and melodies are captured

Text-to-image.
